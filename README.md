redis document storage

This project was at first a server mock for firestore, to store document on redis with elegant api calls, 
but for our projects purpose, we started to add more and more interesting features like queues, locks, list, 
and the most interesting one is ranking and ordered range
by indexes that can be configured for wide usage with one simple line code
